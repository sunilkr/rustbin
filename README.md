# RUSTBIN

![Build Status](https://github.com/sunilkr/rustbin/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

This is a learning project to understand Rust language and create complex file parsers.

---

## Structure

Rustbin is created as a library which shall add more file parsers.

Every value which is part of a header is wrapped in `HeaderField` struct. `HeaderField` struct provides 3 values:

- value: The value of the field read from file
- offset: Offset of the the value in file. Structs have same offset as the offset of their first member
- rva: Relative Virtual Address
  - Applicable only to PE file format
  - Shall be same as offset wherever not applicable

## Supported Now
